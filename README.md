# LLM & AI Agent Development Course

Welcome to the **LLM & AI Agent Development Course**, designed for software engineers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts who want to **transition into AI, LLM, and autonomous agent development**.

## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive, hands-on approach to building AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). You will learn how to design prompts, integrate external knowledge, and deploy AI agents for real-world applications.

### Key Topics

- **Prompt Engineering**: Learn how to design effective prompts to guide LLM behavior.
- **AI Agent Development**: Build autonomous agents capable of performing tasks using LLMs.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Enhance LLM responses with external knowledge.
- **Hands-on Projects**: Implement chatbots, task automation agents, and LLM-powered applications.
- **Tools & Frameworks**: FastAPI, LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, FAISS, and more.

### Who Should Take This Course

- Software engineers, data scientists, or AI practitioners with experience in programming and ML/AI.
- Professionals looking to **transition into AI development** focusing on LLMs and intelligent agents.
- Learners eager to gain **hands-on experience with modern AI tools and frameworks**.

### Prerequisites

- Solid programming background (Python preferred)
